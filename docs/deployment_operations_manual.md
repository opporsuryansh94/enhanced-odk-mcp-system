## Introduction

This comprehensive deployment and operations manual provides detailed guidance for installing, configuring, and maintaining the Enhanced ODK MCP System in production environments. The manual covers multiple deployment scenarios including cloud-based deployments, on-premises installations, and hybrid configurations to meet diverse organizational requirements.

### Deployment Overview and Strategy

The Enhanced ODK MCP System is designed to support flexible deployment strategies that can accommodate organizations of all sizes and technical capabilities. The system can be deployed as a fully managed cloud service, a self-hosted solution on organizational infrastructure, or a hybrid configuration that combines cloud and on-premises components based on specific requirements.

Cloud deployment options provide the fastest path to production with minimal infrastructure management overhead. Major cloud providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are supported with pre-configured deployment templates and automated scaling capabilities. Cloud deployments benefit from managed database services, automatic backup systems, and global content delivery networks.

On-premises deployment provides maximum control over data sovereignty and security while requiring more infrastructure management expertise. On-premises deployments are ideal for organizations with strict data residency requirements, existing infrastructure investments, or specific security and compliance needs that require local data processing.

Hybrid deployment configurations combine cloud and on-premises components to optimize for specific organizational requirements such as data sensitivity, performance, or cost considerations. Common hybrid patterns include cloud-based analytics with on-premises data collection or on-premises primary systems with cloud-based disaster recovery.

Container-based deployment using Docker and Kubernetes provides consistent deployment environments across different infrastructure types while enabling sophisticated scaling and management capabilities. Container deployment includes optimized images, automated health checking, and comprehensive monitoring integration.

### System Requirements and Sizing

Production deployments require careful consideration of system requirements and capacity planning to ensure optimal performance and reliability. The system requirements vary significantly based on the number of users, data collection volume, and analytics complexity, requiring detailed capacity planning for successful deployments.

Minimum system requirements for small deployments (up to 100 concurrent users and 10,000 submissions per month) include 4 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, 500GB storage, and reliable internet connectivity with at least 100 Mbps bandwidth. These requirements support basic data collection and analysis operations with moderate performance expectations.

Medium deployment requirements (up to 1,000 concurrent users and 100,000 submissions per month) include 16 CPU cores, 64GB RAM, 2TB storage, and high-speed internet connectivity with at least 1 Gbps bandwidth. Medium deployments typically require load balancing and database optimization to maintain performance under increased load.

Large deployment requirements (up to 10,000 concurrent users and 1,000,000 submissions per month) include 64 CPU cores, 256GB RAM, 10TB storage, and enterprise-grade network infrastructure with redundant connectivity. Large deployments require sophisticated architecture including multiple application servers, database clustering, and content delivery networks.

Enterprise deployment requirements (unlimited users and submissions) require custom sizing based on specific usage patterns and performance requirements. Enterprise deployments typically include multiple data centers, advanced security features, and dedicated support resources for optimal operation.

Storage requirements include both database storage for structured data and object storage for media files and documents. Database storage grows approximately 1KB per form submission plus additional space for indexes and analytics data. Media storage requirements vary significantly based on the use of photos, videos, and audio recordings in data collection forms.

Network requirements include both bandwidth and latency considerations for optimal user experience. Mobile data collection requires reliable connectivity for synchronization operations, while web-based analytics and reporting require low-latency access for interactive performance. Geographic distribution of users may require content delivery networks or regional deployment strategies.

## Prerequisites and Requirements

Successful deployment of the Enhanced ODK MCP System requires careful preparation of infrastructure, software dependencies, and operational procedures. This section provides comprehensive guidance for preparing deployment environments and ensuring that all prerequisites are met before beginning the installation process.

### Infrastructure Prerequisites

Infrastructure preparation begins with selecting appropriate hardware or cloud resources that meet the system's performance and reliability requirements. Physical hardware deployments require servers with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage capacity along with redundant power supplies, network connectivity, and environmental controls for reliable operation.

Cloud infrastructure preparation involves selecting appropriate instance types, storage configurations, and network settings that provide optimal performance and cost characteristics. Cloud deployments benefit from auto-scaling capabilities, managed database services, and integrated backup and monitoring solutions that reduce operational overhead.

Network infrastructure requirements include reliable internet connectivity with sufficient bandwidth for user access and data synchronization operations. Network security considerations include firewall configuration, VPN access for administrative operations, and DDoS protection for public-facing services. Load balancing and content delivery networks may be required for optimal performance in geographically distributed deployments.

Storage infrastructure includes both high-performance storage for database operations and cost-effective storage for media files and backups. Storage systems should provide appropriate IOPS performance for database workloads and sufficient capacity for data growth over time. Backup storage should be geographically separated from primary storage to ensure disaster recovery capabilities.

Security infrastructure includes certificate management for SSL/TLS encryption, identity and access management systems for user authentication, and security monitoring tools for threat detection and response. Security infrastructure should be designed to meet organizational compliance requirements and industry best practices for data protection.

### Software Dependencies

Software dependency management ensures that all required components are properly installed and configured before deploying the Enhanced ODK MCP System. The system requires specific versions of operating systems, runtime environments, databases, and supporting tools for optimal operation.

Operating system requirements include modern Linux distributions such as Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later, CentOS 8 or later, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or later. Windows Server deployments are supported but require additional configuration for optimal performance. Operating systems should be configured with appropriate security updates and hardening procedures.

Runtime environment dependencies include Python 3.9 or later with specific package versions, Node.js 16 or later for frontend components, and Java 11 or later for certain analytics components. Runtime environments should be configured with appropriate memory limits, garbage collection settings, and monitoring capabilities.

Database dependencies include PostgreSQL 13 or later for primary data storage, Redis 6 or later for caching and session management, and optional MongoDB for document storage requirements. Database systems should be configured with appropriate performance tuning, backup procedures, and monitoring capabilities.

Container runtime dependencies include Docker 20.04 or later and Kubernetes 1.21 or later for container orchestration. Container environments should be configured with appropriate resource limits, security policies, and monitoring integration for production operation.

Supporting tool dependencies include Git for source code management, Nginx or Apache for web server functionality, and various monitoring and logging tools for operational visibility. Supporting tools should be configured with appropriate security settings and integration with organizational management systems.

### Security Prerequisites

Security preparation involves implementing comprehensive security measures that protect the system and its data throughout the deployment and operational lifecycle. Security measures should be implemented at multiple layers including network, application, and data levels to provide defense in depth.

Certificate management includes obtaining and installing SSL/TLS certificates for all public-facing services and internal service communication. Certificates should be obtained from trusted certificate authorities and configured with appropriate security settings including strong cipher suites and perfect forward secrecy.

Identity and access management preparation includes integrating with organizational authentication systems such as Active Directory, LDAP, or SAML identity providers. Multi-factor authentication should be configured for administrative access and can be required for user access based on organizational security policies.
