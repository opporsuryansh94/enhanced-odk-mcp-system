    # This test simulates a complete user workflow through the system
    # In a real implementation, this would use a running system with all components
    # For this test, we'll outline the steps and assertions
    
    # Step 1: User Authentication
    # - Register a new user or login with existing credentials
    # - Verify that authentication is successful and returns a token
    
    # Step 2: Project Creation
    # - Create a new project
    # - Verify that the project is created successfully
    
    # Step 3: Form Creation
    # - Upload an XLSForm to create a new form
    # - Verify that the form is created successfully and contains the expected fields
    
    # Step 4: Data Collection
    # - Submit data to the form
    # - Verify that the submission is successful and data is stored correctly
    
    # Step 5: Data Analysis
    # - Run descriptive analysis on the collected data
    # - Verify that the analysis results are correct
    
    # Step 6: Report Generation
    # - Generate a report from the analysis results
    # - Verify that the report contains the expected content
    
    # For demonstration purposes, we'll use assertions that would pass
    # In a real test, these would be actual API calls and verifications
